# Visualization of Rising / Declining World Emissions

This projects categorizes countries as having rising or declining emissions from 2000-2022.
Two methods are used, one which relies on there being a significant linear trend
over the time period, and another that relies on longitudinal clustering. 
Both give similar results.

Numerous interactive world maps are then generated to visualize 
countries with rising / declining world emissions.

**Those can be found here:** https://wulfnovak.github.io/

Lastly, plots of world emissions are provided in the 'Plots' folder
