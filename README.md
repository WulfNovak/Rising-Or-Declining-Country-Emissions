# Visualization of Rising / Declining Country Emissions

This project categorizes countries as having rising or declining emissions from 2000-2022.
Two methods are used, one which relies on there being a significant linear trend
over the time period, and another that relies on longitudinal clustering. 
Both give similar results.
