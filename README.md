# Visualization of Rising / Declining Country Emissions

This project categorizes countries as having rising or declining emissions from 2000-2022.
Two methods are used, one which relies on there being a significant linear trend
over the time period, and another that relies on longitudinal clustering. 
Both give similar results.

Numerous interactive world maps are then generated to visualize 
countries with rising / declining world emissions.

**Those can be found here:**

 - Simple site to display maps (Coded with HTML / CSS)
 - Animation is known not to scale correctly to page.
   
Lastly, plots of world emissions are provided in the 'Plots' folder
